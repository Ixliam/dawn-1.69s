You can connect to the IMC2 network through one of the servers running *dalnet.
Visit https://www.themud.org/imc2i3-routers.php to see which ones are running,
and pick your local flavor. Make sure the IMC comment is used in the makefile
to get IMC2 to compile. In the IMC directory, edit the config file to reflect
your muds information.

WARNINGS: Sending things from yourself to yourself, such as imctells and imcwho
will crash the mud. Imcwho is only for admins, since it gives a "TRUE" list of 
who is on the mud, including hidden/invis immortals. Imctell has been fixed so
you cannot send a tell to yourself. 

HOTREBOOTING: Once you hotreboot, you will need to manually reconnect to the
network using imcconnect.
